Pedestrian flow dynamics are an\nessential input to infrastructure design as well as efficient and safe operations. Pedestrian walking\nspeed is the most influential traffic flow variable. This study examines the factors influencing pedes-\ntrian walking speed, categorizing them into pedestrian flow characteristics, pedestrian attributes,\nlayout configuration, ambient conditions, and pedestrian behavioral patterns. (2) Methods: A com-\nprehensive literature review was conducted, aggregating studies that investigate pedestrian walking\nspeed across various environments and conditions. The identified factors were systematically catego-\nrized, and a meta-analysis was employed to synthesize the results. (3) Results: Speed measurements\nseem to be dependent on the method and technique employed, with experiments systematically\noverestimating speed and video recordings systematically underestimating it. Pedestrian density\nstrongly influences speed as in motorized traffic. Being female, being of older age, walking in a\ngroup, engaging in social interactions or phone-related tasks, and moving under noise conditions are\nreported to have a negative impact on walking speed. Carrying baggage and moving under adverse\nweather conditions are also reported to have a statistically significant impact, but the direction of the\nimpact is not always the same and seems to be very context dependent. (4) Conclusions: The findings\nhighlight the significance of physiological, psychological, and environmental elements in shaping\npedestrian behavior and thus speed. Valuable insights from this review can assist researchers, de-\nsigners, and operators in providing safer, more inclusive, and reliable infrastructures for pedestrians.\nFuture investigations should broaden the scope of data collection methods, particularly indoors.\n\nheck for\n© updates Keywords: pedestrian; walking speed; walking behavior; influencing factors; pedestrian flow;\nCitation: Giannoulaki, M.; pedestrian facilities\nChristoforou, Z.

Pedestrian movement dynamics have been extensively studied as they are valuable\nThis article is an open access article input for a large number of analyses such as emergency evacuations, pedestrian bridge\ndistributed under the terms and dynamic design, transportation hub, and architectural design. Moving speed is a key\nelement in all these studies as it is directly related to infrastructure operations and level\nof service, under both normal and disrupted conditions [2]. In such cases, walking speed\nis considered equal to the average individual speed of all pedestrians travelling over\n\nconditions of the Creative Commons\nAttribution (CC BY) license (https: //\ncreativecommons.org/licenses/by /\n4.0/).\n\nSustainability 2024, 16, 4813. https:/ /doi.org/10.3390/su16114813 https: //www.mdpi.com/journal/sustainability\n\n\n--- Page 2 ---\nSustainability 2024, 16, 4813 2 of 19\n\nthe same distance in a specific environment. Average speed depends on infrastructure\ndesign elements, ambient conditions, pedestrian density, and overall crowd dynamics.\nUnrestricted pace in optimal conditions, i.e., free-flow speed, is another metric used for\ninfrastructure design. The Transit Capacity and Quality of Service Manual-2nd Edition [2,3]\ndefines a baseline range for free-flow walking speed rate, which ranges from 0.75 m/s\nto 2.41 m/s. This range encompasses both restricted walking and jogging, reflecting the\nsignificant variability in pedestrian speed that arises from numerous factors influencing\nboth desired and actual walking speed. The recommended pedestrian walking speed for\ndesign is 1.25 m/s [2], while the speed assumed for crosswalk signal timing is 1.2 m/s [4].\nHowever, it is worth noting that those reference values differ according to the context.\n\nOf course, average speed is also directly related to pedestrian density, as suggested\nby traffic flow theory. Under low-density regimes, individual pedestrians can travel at\ndesired free-flow speeds, whereas increased densities impose reduced moving speeds [2].\nIncreased densities correspond to lower pedestrian comfort [5], infrastructure efficiency,\nand level of service [6]. Operations at capacity levels maximize pedestrian throughput\nbut create instability in flow dynamics. Stability is particularly important under degraded\nconditions when incidents occur. The impact of minor incidents can be easily absorbed\nunder stable flow, while the impact of major incidents can be mitigated, and emergency\nevacuation of critical facilities can be performed with safety.\n\nTurning to transportation systems in particular, pedestrian dynamics become even\nmore critical in terms of efficient design and operations. Nevertheless, relevant data\nare often unavailable, corresponding parameters are difficult to estimate, and analytical\nformulae are highly complex. Systematic data collection is not common practice, contrary to\ncar traffic, and sensing equipment is not standardized. Even when densities and speeds are\nknown, aggregate indicators may not be able to summarize traffic scenes because, in the case\nof pedestrians, stronger heterogeneity is observed across individuals while environmental\nfactors have greater impact. Also, evolving and/or exogenous parameters prove to be more\ninfluential, as was the case with the recent COVID-19 pandemic when social distancing\ndefined new behavioral patterns [7]. Moreover, space and time continuous models cannot\nsufficiently describe traffic scenes and behavioral choices due to the increased complexity\nlevel that increases with density. Thus, alternative modeling approaches, such as agent-\nbased simulation, progressively gain the preference of researchers performing prospective\nurban studies.\n\nFrom data collection to modeling and future projections, pedestrian speed is an\nessential parameter and an important input for transportation planning, infrastructure\ndesign, and sizing. The factors that affect speed have been extensively studied in the\nliterature, but results are not always converging. Age [8], gender [9], and characteristics\nof the walking environment [10] are commonly reported as being very influential. Other\nanalyzed factors include weather conditions, noise, or adjacent land use [11-13]. Despite\nthe extensive literature on the topic, there is no systematic classification of those factors. To\nthe best of the authors’ knowledge, there exists no comparative assessment of the relative\nimportance of their influence upon pedestrian speed. A better understanding of walking\nspeed determinants would be highly beneficial to infrastructure designers, researchers, and\noperators as capacity and level of service (LoS) result from real speeds.\n\nIn view of the above, the aim of this review is to address two emerging questions:\n(i) which are the main factors affecting pedestrian walking speed, and (ii) to what extent do\nthese factors impact walking speed. In the review, the influencing factors are categorized\ninto five distinct categories as follows:\n\n(1) Pedestrian flow characteristics: including pedestrian traffic states and the impact of\nother pedestrians upon speed (density, flow).\n\n(2) Pedestrian attributes: such as age, gender, and physical attributes that affect pedestrian\nwalking speed.\n\n\n--- Page 3 ---\nSustainability 2024, 16, 4813 3 of 19\n\n(3) Layout configuration: taking into consideration the layout of the walking environ-\nment (e.g., bottlenecks, corridors, inclination, surface), as well as the land use and\npermanent or temporary obstacles.\n\n(4) Ambient conditions: including noises and season/weather conditions.\n\n(5) Pedestrian behavioral patterns: including walking in a group, carrying baggage, and\nusing a mobile phone.\n\nPreferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta Analysis (PRISMA) was\nused as a basis for the systematic review. The Scopus database was employed to collect all\nthe studies concerning the area of interest that were based exclusively on experimental or\nobservational data sources. Medical studies, pedestrian safety, and simulated datasets were\nexcluded from the analysis. Both average real speeds and free-flow horizontal walking\nspeeds were considered, inside a facility or at outdoor areas.\n\nThe paper is structured as follows: Section 2 describes the review methodology\nfollowed, Section 3 presents the factors that affect walking speed along with the extent of\ntheir impact, and Section 4 discusses the main conclusions.\n\n2. Materials and Methods\n2.1. Search Strategy\n\nThe Scopus database was used in May 2022 to identify the relevant literature. The\nkeywords used were “pedestrian walking speed”, and the search was conducted in the\narticles’ title, abstract, and keywords. The limitations’ set for these searches were “English\nlanguage” and “journal articles”. The search provided 863 records in total. Lastly, a\nkeywords selection was made in order to limit the next step of full paper reading. The\nkeywords which were excluded are listed below per discipline:\n\ne Medical studies: wounds and injuries, injury scale, craniocerebral trauma;\ne Pedestrian safety: navigation, collision avoidance; and\ne Simulated data: forecasting.\n\nThis search step provided 641 records. Afterwards, duplicates were removed, and\nthe abstracts were reviewed to check their validity. Categories considered as invalid were\nas follows:\n\ne Data provided from simulation models or prediction models;\n\ne Vertical movement and evacuation experiments;\n\ne _—_ Lateral oscillation structure;\n\ne Studies on pedestrian speed after trauma/stroke or studies on pedestrians with dis-\nabilities or on rehab conditions;\n\ne Studying the effect of speed on behavior (e.g., probability of collision);\n\ne Studies on stride interval or gait gap;\n\ne Monitoring the accessibility or walkability of a city /neighborhood.\n\nFinally, 143 papers proceeded for full-text reading. The abovementioned procedure is\npresented in Figure 1.\n\n2.2. Synthesis Method\n\nThe eligible literature considered includes pedestrian movement or behavior studies\nthrough field observations or structured experiments that report descriptive statistics or\nquantitative analysis of walking speed. Regarding the factors that have an impact on\nwalking speed, the process followed is based on whether the literature is associated with\nthe categories mentioned previously. After detailed full text reading, 96 studies were\nfinally included in the review. Information collected from the literature responds to the\nfollowing information:\n\ne Year when data collection was conducted, if reported, and the country;\ne Location, whether it was a public facility (indoor) or public space (outdoor);\ne Research objective;\n\n\n--- Page 4 ---\nSustainability 2024, 16, 4813 4 of 19\n\ne Data collection method (field observation/experiment), number of participants, dura-\ntion of recordings, and technical means (video camera, stopwatch, etc.);\n\ne Data extraction method;\n\ne Results, including the influential factor and walking speed rates, if reported.\n\nWalking speeds were converted into m+s~1, and averages were calculated if needed.\nRegarding data collection, the identification and validation of abnormal data are beyond\nthe scope of this paper. Additionally, not all papers included in this review provided\ndetailed descriptions of their data collection and analysis methodologies.\n\nLastly, the review includes a meta-analysis of the literature related to walking speed\nrates and influencing factors. The aim of the meta-analysis was to synthesize the results\nfrom multiple studies to provide a comprehensive understanding of the impact of different\nfactors on walking speed rates. The analysis utilized the mean walking speed rates reported\nin the literature and calculated the effect size for each influencing factor. The results of the\nmeta-analysis are presented and discussed in the following sections.\n\nIn the 1970s, the first steps were made in pedestrian behavior and speed analysis\nwith the aid of manual counts. However, most of the studies were performed after the\nyear 2000. Field observations with photographic techniques are the most dominant, with\nthe technical means evolving overtime. Indoor experimental studies are more recent but\naccount for as much as 41% of the collected literature. They employ emerging methods\nfor pedestrian data collection, such as detection systems and virtual reality. In terms of\ngeographical distribution, the largest effort to understand pedestrian dynamics is observed\nin China (21% of total studies). United States of America and United Kingdom follow, with\napproximately 8% each. In Figure 1, the contribution of each country to the discipline of\ninterest is displayed.\n\nFigure 1. Geographical distribution of the studies.\n3. Results\n\nThe influencing factors were categorized into five distinct categories as mentioned\nearlier: (i) pedestrian flow characteristics, (ii) pedestrian attributes, (iii) layout configuration,\n(iv) ambient conditions, and (v) pedestrian behavioral patterns. They are presented in the\nsubsections below.\n\n3.1. Pedestrian Flow Characteristics\n\nTraffic flow theory primarily concerns studies on the movement of vehicular means of\ntransport and employs the fundamental relationship and variables: flow (Q), density (k),\nand speed (V) [1]. The fundamental diagram was first introduced in pedestrian dynamics\nin 1971 when field observations, with the aid of photographic techniques, were employed\n\n\n--- Page 5 ---\nSustainability 2024, 16, 4813 5 of 19\n\nand the relationship of density with speed was defined [3]. The difference to car traffic is\nthat density is here measured in number of pedestrians over a squared metric of walkway\nlength. As presented by [14,15], flow (Q) is an essential variable in pedestrian flow theory;\nhowever, density (k) serves as the key influencing factor on pedestrian speed.\n\nThe inverse relationship between speed and density was confirmed in the posterior\nfield and experimental studies. Field studies using various video recording techniques\nwere implemented in different street environments including walkways [16,17], signalized\nintersections [9], unsignalized intersections [18], and sidewalks [19-23]. Similar conclusions\nwere reached with manual counts in [24]. Interestingly, two field studies report a positive\ncorrelation between density and speed for low density levels [15,25]. The negative correla-\ntion is proven only for higher densities, presumably corresponding to the congested part of\nthe fundamental diagram. Turning to controlled experiments, all studies confirm the nega-\ntive correlation between speed and density either using videographic techniques [9,26-34]\nor manual counting [25]. All the reported relationships are presented in Table 1.\n\nTable 1.

Dense crowds in a walkable space prevent pedestrians from walking\nfreely at a desired speed and increase the travel time, which is also stated by [2].\n\n\n--- Page 6 ---\nSustainability 2024, 16, 4813 6 of 19\n\n3.2. Pedestrian Attributes\n\nThis subsection considers two crucial pedestrian attributes found in the literature,\ni.e., gender and age, and discusses their influence on pedestrian walking speed.\n\nStarting from gender differences, almost all studies find that males generally walk\nfaster than females under all circumstances and street environments: signalized or non-\nsignalized crosswalks [38-49], walkways [23,35,50-56], sidewalks [25,57,58], and inside\npublic facilities [10,34,59-61]. This difference in speed is attributed to gait characteristics,\nwhich lead to bigger stride for men [60], the fearless behavior of men [62], the security\ndistance that appears to be higher for women [34], or the fact that women tend to chat more\non the mobile phone or when walking in a group which distracts their movement [9].\n\nInterestingly, some studies report higher speeds for females, under specific circum-\nstances. The authors of [36] manually counted the walking speed on a walkway at a\nteaching hospital facility and found the mean walking speed for females to be 3.5% higher.\nCrossing speeds at signalized crosswalks are higher for females according to [40,63]. Lastly,\nfemale dyads had higher speed when walking unrestricted on a campus walkway during\na field observation in China [64]. Table 2 provides average speed values found in the\ncollected literature per gender while considering different data collection methods. The\ntable is sorted by method, data collection, and location.\n\nTable 2.

Children seem to walk slower than\nyoung adults who walk faster than seniors [15,37,38,48,52,58,65-67], which is primarily\nattributed to health conditions in the elderly and differences in body stamina and struc-\nture [60]. However, in some cases, higher speeds for children comparing to adults were\nreported [37,39,43].\n\nThe walking speed of younger and middle-aged pedestrians is greater than that of\nseniors, with the speed decreasing as age increases [27,35,39,42,44,47,48,54,56,57,63,68-70].\nThe abovementioned statement has been established by controlled experiments as\nwell [50,59,71-74]. Lastly, crossing times have been thoroughly studied concerning se-\nniors resulting in insufficient time for them when crossing an intersection due to their lower\nspeed and their need for larger personal space [49,60,75,76].\n\nThis subsection underlines the influence of pedestrians’ characteristics, gender, and\nage on speed. In general, males are reported to walk faster; however, this statement can be\nrebutted under some circumstances. Regarding age parameter, speed can be characterized\nby an inverted U-shaped curve. In Table 3, age-based walking speed rates are presented.\nThe table is sorted by method, data collection, and location.\n\n\n--- Page 8 ---\nSustainability 2024, 16, 4813 8 of 19\n\nTable 3.

Layout Configuration\n\nIn the environment configuration subsection, we identify two main categories relevant\nto the study of the factors that influence pedestrian walking speed: (i) walking outdoors\n(signalized or not intersections, pavements, etc.) and (ii) walking indoors. Within these cat-\negories, we consider several key factors that may influence pedestrian behavior, including\nthe slope and angle of the walking surface, the land use and size of the city, and design\nelements such as obstacles and the condition of pavement.\n\nAn early study analyzed pedestrian walking behavior when walking both indoors and\noutdoors and claimed that pedestrians seem to be faster when walking outdoors [24] for\nsafety and weather conditions issues [60]. Walking elements and their design have impact\non speed including street sections, crosswalks, pavements, etc. [44,51,58,62]; crosswalk\nlength and front distance length [27,67,77]; crossing markings [45,78]; street width [42]; and\non street motor vehicle parking [22]. Walking speed is positively correlated with city size\naccording to [15,55]. Moreover, the land use in terms of walkability plays an important role\nin walking speed [12,26,43,57,58]. The speed decrease with the inclination [28,50,52,54,56,79]\nand cold weather effect on pavement such as ice [54]. Contrary to the abovementioned, no\nimpact of pavement width and its condition [23] as well as traffic control [48] were reported.\n\nRegarding indoor walking behavior, a negative correlation between the degree of\nthe angle and the speed [80-84], as well as the presence of obstacles [75,79], are reported.\nOn the other hand, a positive correlation between (i) the height of the walls [29] that\npedestrians are reported to walk away from [85] and (ii) the presence of guiding signs [10]\nwhen walking within an enclosed passageway with the speed are reported.\n\nIn conclusion, walking environment configuration has several attributes that influence\npedestrian walking behavior and, hence, their speed. The difference between walking\n\n\n--- Page 10 ---\nSustainability 2024, 16, 4813 10 of 19\n\nindoors and outdoors is not clear because it depends on many different factors such as the\ncondition of the pavement, the turning angle, the slope, and moving or stable constraints.\n\n3.4. Ambient Conditions\n\nThe ambient conditions identified as influential are (i) sound and light and (ii) weather\nconditions.\n\nThe sound environment may concern “nature sounds” such as birdsong and rustling\nleaves and “noise” including disruptive sounds, like traffic and human activities. Studies\non the impact of noise or nature sounds on pedestrian behavior showed speed differentia-\ntions [11,25,86]. Significant correlation between walking speed and environmental sounds\nwas established by [87], who reported higher speed rates for nature sounds than traffic\nnoises. Apart from soundscape conditions, Pedersen and Johansson (2018) found that\nlighting conditions significantly impact pedestrian walking characteristics, revealing that\nlower lighting levels led to a decrease in walking speed. [76].\n\nRegarding the weather conditions, the literature revealed a significant impact of\nweather conditions on speed [15], although the results do not converge. Weather conditions\nmay have negative effects on pavement condition (ice, snow, etc.) and result in more\ncarefully walking behavior and, hence, lower walking speed rates [13,54]. However,\nseveral studies report higher speeds for pedestrians under adverse weather in order to\nreach the destination quickly and protect themselves [9,13,51,60,61]. Contrarily to the latter,\nBr&Sti¢ and Kanda [88] stated no weather effect on pedestrian speed when individuals were\nwalking in a shopping center.\n\n3.5. Pedestrian Behavioral Patterns\n\nThis subsection analyzes the effect of pedestrian behavior in walking speed. More\nspecifically, walking in a group, smartphone usage, and carrying a bag are the main\ncategories mentioned.\n\nWalking in a group seems to affect pedestrian speed [30,89]. A noteworthy speed re-\nduction is mentioned when walking in a group, in most cases, regardless the number of the\nmembers [9,17,38,40,41,47,51,58,63,65,67,90]. A reason for this lies in the social relationship\nand interaction that leads to gait alterations in order to obtain similar speed [91]. Some\nresearchers report a lower influence of the group effect when moving in pairs [15,42,45].\n\nMobile phone usage seems to decrease walking speed. A noteworthy number of authors\nreport that all technological uses (including mobile-phone-related tasks, headphones, etc.)\nhave a negative impact on pedestrian walking behavior [62,92-99]. Moreover, reduced speed\nand distraction is known to have significant safety implications, especially when pedestrians\ncross the road.\n\nFindings are not conclusive regarding the impact of carrying luggage on walking\nspeed. The literature reports both a negative [9,38,40,41,57,100] and positive effect [52,58,63]\non luggage-laden pedestrians’ speed as well as pedestrians around them [100]. Some\nresearchers even report an absence of impact on walking speed [39,47,61,71,101], which\nmay be due to the combination of some positive and negative parameters. The size of the\nluggage and travel purpose may be determinant in the direction of this relationship but has\nnot been explored so far. Commuters carrying briefcases may walk faster than the average\nflow stream, whereas tourists carrying heavy luggage may walk slower than the average\nflow stream.\n\nAdditional distractive factors that were found to change pedestrian walking speed\nare facial expressions and staring [89], the surrounding speed [33], the fear of falling when\ncrossing an intersection [44], the waiting time at a crosswalk [102], and smoking [59]. In\nTable 4, the abovementioned influencing factors are presented.\n\n\n--- Page 11 ---\nSustainability 2024, 16, 4813 11 of 19\n\nTable 4.

Meta Analysis\n\nA meta-analysis was conducted on the collected literature in an effort to gain additional\ninsight on both the results and methods used to obtain them as well as on the potential\ninfluence of the collection method on results. On the means of observation, the meta-\nanalysis reveals that the most frequently utilized method is field observations, accounting\nfor 61%. Cameras are predominantly employed for both field observations (60%) and\nexperiments (38%), while “other methods”, such as detection systems and virtual reality\n(VR) technology, are reported for experiments (24%), which offer more flexibility compared\nto other methods, as the environment and scenarios can be replicated. An insightful\nobservation is that the majority of studies were conducted after 2010, comprising 76% of\nthe total (41% of the experiments and 59% of the observations). On the contrary, before\n2010, manual tracking was mostly used for field observations. Regarding the location\nof the studies, a significant percentage of the research was conducted in China (21%),\nfollowed by the United States of America (8%) and the United Kingdom (7%). The lowest\npedestrian velocity was reported at signalized crossings, likely due to the higher density\ncaused by traffic light cycle, which potentially results in restricted movement, while the\nhighest velocity was observed at walkways.\n\nTurning to the influential factors and the fundamental relationship of traffic, walking speed\nrates were estimated for given density values using different reported relationships (Figure 2).\nThe findings show a consistent pattern confirming the well-established negative correlation\nbetween density and speed. However, a single study reported an inverse relationship [15].\n\nPedestrian characteristics, specifically gender and age, were examined using two main\ndata collection methods: video recording and manual tracking. Although both methods\nshowed that men walk 9% faster than women (Figure 3), under specific circumstances (such\nas traffic control at crosswalks), the opposite is reported. Markedly, controlled experiments\nreport 30% higher average for both genders’ walking speeds compared to field observations\n(Figures 3 and 4). Manual counting (vs. video recordings) provides higher speed values\nin all cases. This is particularly true in the case of experimental studies and needs further\ninvestigation. Also, outdoor velocity rates were reported to be 38% higher than indoor\nfacilities’ speeds (Table 5).\n\n\n--- Page 12 ---\nSustainability 2024, 16, 4813 12 of 19\n\nSpeed change rate by collected fundamental relationships\n\n1 ee\n\n0 TSS\n1 1.2 1.4 1.6 1.8 2 2.2 2.6\n\nDensity (ped/m“2)\n—— Walmsley & Lewis, 1989 Gore et al., 2021 Gore et al., 2021\n——Alhassan & Mashros, 2015 ——Lametal., 1995 —— Lam et al., 1995\n——Lam et al., 1995 —— Lametal., 1995 —— M.

How-\never, disparities are observed in the magnitude of the speed reduction. Again, manual\ncounts provide higher speed rates compared to video recordings for all age groups and\nindependently of the data collection method. Interestingly, detection systems used provide\nvalues close to manual counting and not video recordings that seem to be less reliable\nand to consistently underestimate speed rates at around 20% (Figure 5). Last but not least,\npeople aged 55 and more reported to have 17% lower speed than the average of the studies\nand 11% than the proposed speed by Highway Capacity Manual [1].\n\nWalking in groups and carrying loads were identified as factors influencing pedestrian\nspeed. Social interactions and group size were found to consistently reduce walking speed,\nwith the highest reduction being observed in larger groups. The highest reduction was\nfound in groups with five or more members and is approximately 27%. Field observation\nusing video cameras is the most common method used to investigate this issue, although\nmanual tracking methods also support this finding (Table 6). The influence of carrying\nbaggage on pedestrian speed behavior is still inconclusive, regardless of the method\nemployed to collect pedestrian data. Some studies suggest that carrying loads has a\nnegative effect on speed, while others found higher speeds for luggage-laden pedestrians.\nSignificant differences between controlled experiments and field observations emerged\naccording to meta-analysis, with 41% lower average speed for field observations. Lastly,\nobservations made in different contexts strongly indicate that any phone-related task has\nonly a negative effect on walking speed.\n\n\n--- Page 14 ---\nSustainability 2024, 16, 4813 14 of 19\n\nSpeed rate by age and data collection method\n\nChildren Young Adults Adults Middle-aged Seniors\n\n@ Videographic Techniques mManual Counts m Mixed Methods m Detection System\n\nFigure 5.

Conclusions and Discussion\n\nPedestrian walking speed is an essential input to infrastructure design and an impor-\ntant variable determining the level of service and the safety of operations. The objective of\nthis study is to provide a comprehensive review of the literature on pedestrian walking\nspeed and the factors having an impact on speeds. Influential factors were organized\nin the following categories: (i) pedestrian flow characteristics, (ii) pedestrian attributes,\n(iii) layout configuration, (iv) ambient conditions, and (v) pedestrian behavioral patterns.\n\nIn terms of observational methods, the literature includes both field observations\nand controlled experiments. The data collection techniques were mostly video recordings,\nmanual counts, or detection systems. This trend reflects advancements in observational\ntechnology and methodologies post 2010, underscoring the increasing precision of data\ncollection in pedestrian research. However, the meta-analysis performed indicates that re-\nsults are dependent upon the observational method and the data collection technique. The\nimpact concerns the value of estimated walking speed and not the direction of the impact of\ninfluential factors. Field observations report 40% lower average walking speed compared\nto experiments. Detection systems and manual counts are related with higher speed and\nvideographic techniques with lower. This finding is important as it suggests that future\nexperimental protocols should be revised to address the issue. For example, all measure-\nments, field or experimental, should include at least some manual counts as a benchmark,\nand it is also important to explore methods for the optimal placement of sensors [103,104]\nor measurement uncertainties [105] to ensure the accuracy of data collection.\n\nTurning to influential factors, the fundamental flow characteristics (i.e., mainly den-\nsity) are found to have a strong impact on speeds, similarly to motorized traffic. The\n\n\n--- Page 15 ---\nSustainability 2024, 16, 4813 15 of 19\n\nmeta-analysis confirms the negative correlation between speed and density. The higher\nnegative gradient in speed curve occurs at signalized crosswalks when using videographic\nmethods and manual counts. In contrast, a negligible increase is reported in walkways\nwhen using solely manual counts. Outdoor walkways experience a smaller decrease com-\npared to indoor walkways and sidewalks. Lastly, experimental settings show in general\na higher rate of speed decrease compared to observations in the field. These findings un-\nderscore the interplay between infrastructure design, traffic management, and pedestrian\nbehavior, emphasizing the need for integrated approaches in urban planning. In general,\nthe pedestrian flow relationship is data collection method and infrastructure dependent\nand is fundamental for designing pedestrian facilities. Recent research, as highlighted\nin [106], has contributed significantly to addressing this challenge by developing a tool\nto generate situation-specific fundamental diagrams. However, other factors come into\nplay. They are related to pedestrians’ physiology and psychology as well as to the built\nenvironment and ambient conditions. Being female, being of older age, walking in a group,\nengaging in social interactions or phone-related tasks, and moving under noise conditions\nare reported to mostly have a negative impact on walking speed. Males are reported to\nwalk faster, although this statement can be rebutted. Interestingly, carrying baggage also\nhas a non-conclusive influence as, in some cases, it increases while in others it decreases\nspeed. We may assume that the direction of the influence depends on travel purpose\nand baggage size. Regarding the age factor, the review considers the influence follows an\ninverse U-shape curve with the average walking speed of seniors to be the lowest walking\nspeed reported, followed by children. Walking environment and weather conditions are\nreported to have a statistically significant impact, but the direction of the impact is not\nalways the same and seems to be very context dependent.\n\nThis review offers valuable insights for researchers, designers, and operators. In the\nresearch community, there is a need for the development of experimental and field observa-\ntion protocols that incorporate benchmarks regarding walking speed to ensure accurate\ndata collection and analysis. Furthermore, designers and operators should consider not\nonly passenger volume but also the specific profile of pedestrians to enhance capacity and\nsafety. However, this review suffers from certain limitations and gaps that need to be ad-\ndressed. Methodological variations in speed estimation highlight the importance of further\nexploration not only of the physiological and psychological dynamics in pedestrian studies\nbut also the methodological framework. Understanding these discrepancies is essential for\ndesigning pedestrian-friendly environments and addressing potential safety hazards associ-\nated with distractions. Enhancing pedestrian safety and mobility requires an understanding\nof influential factors and their interactions within urban environments. Addressing these\ngaps will advance our understanding of pedestrian dynamics and inform evidence-based\ninterventions for creating safer and more inclusive pedestrian environments. First, the\nliterature examined does not include new emerging data collection techniques /methods\nas they are not yet well-established, and they present important heterogeneity making\nthem difficult to classify. Regarding data collection methods and extraction processes, it is\ncrucial to consider the disturbances and challenges encountered to ensure the reliability\nand validity of research findings. Factors such as environmental conditions, technological\nlimitations, and human errors can introduce biases or inaccuracies in the collected data.\nThese disturbances can significantly impact the outcomes of studies, leading to misleading\nconclusions or unreliable results. Additionally, the literature should broaden its scope to\nencompass a wider range of influencing factors, particularly in indoor environments. It is\nalso important to acknowledge that the methods employed in the literature review may\nhave inherent limitations. Considering the meta-analysis, shortcomings in result reliability\nand accuracy should be examined. Novel methods presented by [107,108] can be helpful in\nimproving the accuracy and reliability of the analysis.\n\n\n--- Page 16 ---\nSustainability 2024, 16, 4813 16 of 19\n\nFunding: This research was funded by the Research Committee of the University of Patras via\n“C.
